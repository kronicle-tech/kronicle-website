Here's the short to near term roadmap for Kronicle: 

| # | Roadmap Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add support for finding Git repos on GitLab | Kronicle already supports GitHub and Bitbucket Service but GitLab is not yet supported.  |
| 2 | Split the code in [Gradle Scanner](https://github.com/kronicle-tech/kronicle/tree/main/service/src/main/java/tech/kronicle/service/scanners/gradle) into its own independent library | |
| 3 | Plugin architecture for Java code | Use something like [PF4J](https://github.com/pf4j/pf4j) to add plugin support to Kronicle |
